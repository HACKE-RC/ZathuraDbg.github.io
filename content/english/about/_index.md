ZathuraDbg is an open-source GUI emulation based debugger for assembly. The primary goal of ZathuraDbg is to make the process of learning assembly easier by having a clean UI that explains itself and works on the go.

Only x86_64 architecture is supported at the moment but we plan to support all major architectures over the time.
